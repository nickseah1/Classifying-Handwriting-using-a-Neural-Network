# Classifying-Handwriting-using-a-Neural-Network


The purpose of this project is to build a neural network to be able to classify handwriting images as the numbers 0-9.

The neural network has 100 hidden nodes, 10 output nodes, and uses a learning rate of 0.3.

We were able to achieve model performance of 94.7%!
